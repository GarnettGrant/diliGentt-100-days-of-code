# 100 DAYS OF CODE PRESENTED BY diliGentt

My name is Garnett Grant, I am a student at Centennial College registered in the Software Engineering Technology - Artificial Intelligence program and I am grateful to say I have just completed my first year of college by the grace of God. 2 semesters down, 4 more to go. With that being said, I want to motivate my peers and myself to continue in our journey to becoming the best software engineers we can be. This can only be done by dedicating ourselves to learning and adapting our skills daily which will ultimately prepare us for industry-level work, and potentially, developing our own businesses. 

It is my pleasure to introduce this challenge inspired by a GitHub repo I found called "100 days of Code" (<a href="https://github.com/kallaway/100-days-of-code">100-Days-Of-Code</a>) as well as inspired by a friend's "60 days to summer" challenge that I am going to be part taking in shortly (physical health).

Within this challenge, all participants will commit to literally coding for at least an hour for 100 days straight. These 100 days can be within the time span of April 24th to August 28th but must be 100 days  in total to be considered for the incentive for the "best project". Even if you don't make it for the 100 days, this is still a great opportunity to get into the habit of developing our skills further as we get closer to being rooted within our careers. With 1/3 years completed in our journey, preparing is the only step to make. Of course, burnout is real so we should not overwhelm ourselves nor am I promoting that in any way possible. With that being said if there is a day where you do not feel motivated to code, do research for 30 minutes(take notes), and reflect on that research by constructing a paragraph for 30 minutes to ensure that you remember what you learned. This research should also be pushed to GitHub in the format of an .md file.


All the best and let the coding begin!


Anytime between these dates
