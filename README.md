# 100 DAYS OF CODE PRESENTED BY diliGentt

My name is Garnett Grant, I am a student at Centennial College registered in the Software Engineering Technology - Artificial Intelligence program and I am grateful to say I have just completed my first year of college by the grace of God. 2 semesters down, 4 more to go. With that being said, I want to motivate my peers and myself to continue in our journey to becoming the best software engineers we can be. This can only be done by dedicating ourselves to learning and adapting our skills daily which will ultimately prepare us for industry-level work, and potentially, developing our own businesses. 

It is my pleasure to introduce this challenge inspired by a GitHub repo I found called "100 days of Code" (<a href="https://github.com/kallaway/100-days-of-code">100-Days-Of-Code</a>) as well as inspired by a friend's "60 days to summer" challenge that I am going to be part taking in shortly (physical health).

Within this challenge, all participants will commit to literally coding for at least an hour for 100 days straight. These 100 days can be within the time span of April 24th to August 28th but must be 100 days  in total to be considered for the incentive for the "best project". Even if you don't make it for the 100 days, this is still a great opportunity to get into the habit of developing our skills further as we get closer to being rooted within our careers. With 1/3 years completed in our journey, preparing is the only step to make. Of course, burnout is real so we should not overwhelm ourselves nor am I promoting that in any way possible. With that being said if there is a day where you do not feel motivated to code, do research for 30 minutes(take notes), and reflect on that research by constructing a paragraph for 30 minutes to ensure that you remember what you learned. This research should also be pushed to GitHub in the format of an .md file.


All the best and let the coding begin!



# Required:
1. Verify your participation by reacting to the role in the discord Channel #reaction-roles, 
	located under the main hub category,
	(You will receive a role and be added to a participant list)
	
2. After verifying participation, share you GitHub profile link either in the chat 
	or keep it in your bio (It will be added to the participant list but just for reference 
	and to motivate peers)
	
3. GitHub uploads:

	If you're working on a single project for the entire 100 days:
	- An Initial .md documentation containing: 
		ยง Project Scope
		ยง Problem Statement
		ยง Solution Statement
	- An .md log containing each date, progress, and link to commit (Updated Daily)
		
	If you're working on different concepts throughout the 100 days
	- An .md log containing the scope/content of the code, each date, progress, 
	  and link to commit(Updated daily)
		
4. Don't get frustrated, understand we're all learning!
	
5. Have fun :D

## Main Commitment
### *I will code for at least an hour every day for the next 100 days.*

#### Start Date

Date Range: April 24th - August 28th 
133 Day space!!!!


## Ideas to make this challenge more effective
1. To increase the chances of success, it's a requirement that you add a link to each of the day posts in the [log](log.md). It can be a link to a commit on GitHub, a link to a blog post
2. If you get upset or stuck, read this article: [Learning to Code: When It Gets Dark](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/learning-to-code-when-it-gets-dark-e485edfb58fd/)
3. If you don't know why there is such an emphasis on working on the projects vs doing tutorials or online courses, read this: [How to Get a Developer Job in Less Than a Year](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-get-a-developer-job-in-less-than-a-year-c27bbfe71645/)
4. Another good bonus of forking this repo -> if you haven't worked with Markdown before, it's a good way to practice.
