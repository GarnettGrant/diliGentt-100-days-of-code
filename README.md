  have dedicated their time, resources, and skills to completing the challenge to the best of their ability, logging their efforts, and perservering. I am 
  grateful to have classmates, and new friends such as **George**, **Priscilla**, and **Rebecca** who have put their heart into commiting towards their future! I look 
  forward to seeing all the successful endevaours you will all contribute to and I am a proud friend!
