# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: Monday, April 25, 2022

**Today's Progress**: 
Started a new challenge - 30 Days of JavaScript.
Forked the repo and started to follow along with the lessons.


**Thoughts** ...
Pretty basic JS stuff but at the same time very informative as theres some stuff that wasn't covered in my JS class that has already been brought up and I appreicate that a lot. 
For example, I Learned the difference betweeen primitive data types and non-primite data types, and I probably should of known this already but everything in JavaScript is an object lol.
I got through all of Day 1 as I do have prior knowledge in JavaScript but I have finished halfway through day 2 which I will pick up on tomorrow.

### Day 2: Tuesday, April 26, 2022

**Today's Progress**: 
Continued in Day 2 of 30 days of JavaScript challenge
Continued learning about the difference between primitive and non primitive data types
Got a peak at regex again
Completed the first Level Excercise, basic js stuff, still had me thinking but I completed it, I will continue tomorrow for 3 hours rather than 1 as I don't have work and see how far I get, Lord's willing. 

**Thoughts** ...
I appreciate going back over lessons again. I say this because things will stand out to me that didn't really stand out before. For example, being able to use the + operator to cast a data type was foreign knowledge to me. I do feel like a noob going back to the basics when I just finished a 14 week program in all of this, but I don't want to advance to learning ReactJS etc, until I get the foundation laid firm... I'm estatic to jump into a project but I again I want my foundation firm... Lord's willing by the end of my summer break, I will have mastered DHTML+ :)

<h3>Day 3: Wednesday, April 27, 2022</h3>

**Today's Progress**: 
Continued in Day 2 of 30 days of JavaScript challenge
Completed Excercise Level 2 of Day 2 
Updated my GitHub ReadME by inspiration from other GitHubers (idk if thats what we're called LOL)

**Thoughts** ...
Yesterday, I said I would commit to 3 hours of coding... I only got in about 1 due to my tiredness. No excuses, but I am grateful to have gotten the rest I did. I was able to start and complete the second excercise of Day 2 in the 30 days of JavaScript challenge... and I have one more Excercise to go, Level 3. I would love to have finished it today and start Day 3 today which was my original plan but I will get to it eventually... Grateful for these excercises at the end of the lessons that actually help me ponder what I'm doing and choose an approach that is suitable to me.

<h3>Day 4: Thursday, April 28, 2022</h3>

**Today's Progress**: 
Continued in Day 2 of 30 days of JavaScript challenge
Semi Completed Excercise Level 3 of Day 2

**Thoughts** ...
Long day.. Got home late from work... Got into a short bible study, got into doing the third level excercise and completed all the questions except for one... regex Loll I couldn't figure out how to match the pattern and use the replace method to appropriately reaplce the incorrect text. I'll figure it out.... Debating whether I should spend my session tomorrow figuring it out, or just move on to Day 3 of the program.
