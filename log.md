# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: Monday, April 25, 2022

**Today's Progress**: 
Started a new challenge - 30 Days of JavaScript.
Forked the repo and started to follow along with the lessons.


**Thoughts** ...
Pretty basic JS stuff but at the same time very informative as theres some stuff that wasn't covered in my JS class that has already been brought up and I appreicate that a lot. 
For example, I Learned the difference betweeen primitive data types and non-primite data types, and I probably should of known this already but everything in JavaScript is an object lol.
I got through all of Day 1 as I do have prior knowledge in JavaScript but I have finished halfway through day 2 which I will pick up on tomorrow.

### Day 2: Tuesday, April 26, 2022

**Today's Progress**: 
Continued in Day 2 of 30 days of JavaScript challenge
Continued learning about the difference between primitive and non primitive data types
Got a peak at regex again
Completed the first Level Excercise, basic js stuff, still had me thinking but I completed it, I will continue tomorrow for 3 hours rather than 1 as I don't have work and see how far I get, Lord's willing. 

**Thoughts** ...
I appreciate going back over lessons again. I say this because things will stand out to me that didn't really stand out before. For example, being able to use the + operator to cast a data type was foreign knowledge to me. I do feel like a noob going back to the basics when I just finished a 14 week program in all of this, but I don't want to advance to learning ReactJS etc, until I get the foundation laid firm... I'm estatic to jump into a project but I again I want my foundation firm... Lord's willing by the end of my summer break, I will have mastered DHTML+ :)

<h3>Day 3: Wednesday, April 27, 2022</h3>

**Today's Progress**: 
Continued in Day 2 of 30 days of JavaScript challenge
Completed Excercise Level 2 of Day 2 
Updated my GitHub ReadME by inspiration from other GitHubers (idk if thats what we're called LOL)

**Thoughts** ...
Yesterday, I said I would commit to 3 hours of coding... I only got in about 1 due to my tiredness. No excuses, but I am grateful to have gotten the rest I did. I was able to start and complete the second excercise of Day 2 in the 30 days of JavaScript challenge... and I have one more Excercise to go, Level 3. I would love to have finished it today and start Day 3 today which was my original plan but I will get to it eventually... Grateful for these excercises at the end of the lessons that actually help me ponder what I'm doing and choose an approach that is suitable to me.

<h3>Day 4: Thursday, April 28, 2022</h3>

**Today's Progress**: 
Continued in Day 2 of 30 days of JavaScript challenge
Semi Completed Excercise Level 3 of Day 2

**Thoughts** ...
Long day.. Got home late from work... Got into a short bible study, got into doing the third level excercise and completed all the questions except for one... regex Loll I couldn't figure out how to match the pattern and use the replace method to appropriately replace the incorrect text. I'll figure it out.... Debating whether I should spend my session tomorrow figuring it out, or just move on to Day 3 of the program.

**UPDATE**...
I was missing a global definition -_- literally a /g
Shoutout <a href="https://github.com/PriscillaBakradze">Priscilla</a>!!!

<h3>Day 5: Friday, April 29, 2022</h3>

**Today's Progress & Thoughts**: 
Going to start Day 3 Tomorrow evening. :( Researched a bit about Maps to see if I can use it as a solution to the final question in the previous days final excercise, "Find the most frequenet word." I feel like there's an easy answer to it but google & stackoverflow are hinting at mapping the data and then using that to find the most frequent word... I really do feel like there's an easier way given that this is only Day 2 of the course...We'll find out lol.

<h3>Day 6: Saturday, April 30, 2022</h3>

**Today's Progress**: 
Started Day 3 of the 30 day JavaScript challenge (Booleans, Operators, Date Object)

**Thoughts**:
I feel like I'm progresing slowly and the evidence is my lack to keep in sync with the days. Of course this is due to personal reasons but that's not excuse on my side. I will have to appoint time to catch up and resync the days which I will do by God's grace. Today, I've completed excercise Lvl 1, and I'm looking forward to complete the other two excercises, tomorrow afternoon/evening.
