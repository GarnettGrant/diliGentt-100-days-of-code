# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: Monday, April 25, 2022

**Today's Progress**: 
Started a new challenge - 30 Days of JavaScript.
Forked the repo and started to follow along with the lessons.


**Thoughts** ...
Pretty basic JS stuff but at the same time very informative as theres some stuff that wasn't covered in my JS class that has already been brought up and I appreicate that a lot. 
For example, I Learned the difference betweeen primitive data types and non-primite data types, and I probably should of known this already but everything in JavaScript is an object lol.
I got through all of Day 1 as I do have prior knowledge in JavaScript but I have finished halfway through day 2 which I will pick up on tomorrow.

### Day 2: Tuesday, April 26, 2022

**Today's Progress**: 
Continued in Day 2 of 30 days of JavaScript challenge
Continued learning about the difference between primitive and non primitive data types
Got a peak at regex again
Completed the first Level Excercise, basic js stuff, still had me thinking but I completed it, I will continue tomorrow for 3 hours rather than 1 as I don't have work and see how far I get, Lord's willing. 

**Thoughts** ...
I appreciate going back over lessons again. I say this because things will stand out to me that didn't really stand out before. For example, being able to use the + operator to cast a data type was foreign knowledge to me. I do feel like a noob going back to the basics when I just finished a 14 week program in all of this, but I don't want to advance to learning ReactJS etc, until I get the foundation laid firm... I'm estatic to jump into a project but I again I want my foundation firm... Lord's willing by the end of my summer break, I will have mastered DHTML+ :)
